# sheypoor-home-page
sheypoor.com home page with HTML, CSS, JS  Not responsive

# description 

I created this project with HTMl,CSS and Javascript for making the page more dynamic and user interactive.
most of my challenge of creating it was for me to work with js and use it in real project.

some of these challeges were:

* how to make an overlay and when a button is clicked the overlay is shown or hidden.
* how to make a drop down.
* how to make a slider,make it draggable and have buttons that when clicked slides will change smoothly.
* handle and learn some of the advanced css properties.

when I learned to work with dom manipulation implementing the above challenges were easier to do.
